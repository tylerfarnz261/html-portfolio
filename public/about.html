<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Tyler Farnsworth. I am a former FSU Graduate with my B.S. in Computer
  Engineering. I have a huge passion for programming and understanding the way things work.
  I am passionate about building useful applications in and out of my professional life.
</p>

<p>I graduted in the summer of 2023, and started working for a company called
  Art-Fx Studios. Yes, an art studio. Art-Fx Studios is primarily focused on 
  family entertainment theming, attractions like lazer tags and escape rooms, which happens to be
  a huge hobby of mine. I used my resources and knowledge 
  to help push them into a new wave of technology and automate
  props and puzzles throughout all of the products they sold.
</p>

<p>Throughout my time with Art-Fx Studios I was constantly learning
  new techniques and constantly improving my programming skills. I look
  forward to being able to continue my professional relationship with them; however,
  I am looking for a position a bit more challenging, where I can learn and be a part
  of a team of skilled developers so I can consume as much as I can about
  the industry.
